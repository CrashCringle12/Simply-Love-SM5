# Installing Simply Love

If you are upgrading from a previous version of Simply Love, fully delete the old Simply Love folder before moving the new folder into place.  **Do not try to merge the new folder into the old.**

You can read about and download the current release of Simply Love at the [Latest Release](https://github.com/quietly-turning/Simply-Love-SM5/releases/latest) page.

To install Simply Love, unzip it and move the resulting *Simply Love* folder into your [StepMania user data directory](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/wiki/User-Data-Locations).

The install paths will look like:

* **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\StepMania 5.1\Themes\Simply Love\`
* **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/StepMania 5.1/Themes/Simply Love/`
* **Linux**: `~/.stepmania-5.1/Themes/Simply Love/`

The next time you use StepMania, you can switch to Simply Love from the main options menu found on the Title Screen.  The exact process can vary depending on the theme you are currently using, but this is usually done within **Options → Display Options → Appearance Options → Theme**
