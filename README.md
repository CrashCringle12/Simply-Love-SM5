## About

Simply Love is a StepMania 5 theme for the post-ITG community.

It features a clean and simple design, offers numerous data-driven features not implemented by the StepMania 5 engine, and allows the current generation of ITG fans to breathe new life into the game they've known for over a decade.

Simply Love was originally designed and implemented for a previous version of StepMania (SM3.95) by hurtpiggypig.  For more information on that version of Simply Love, check here:

## Setup

You'll need to install [StepMania 5.0.12](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/releases/tag/v5.0.12) or [StepMania 5.1 beta](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/releases/tag/v5.1.0-b2) to use this theme.

Older versions of StepMania are not compatible.  StepMania 5.2 is not compatible.

### Troubleshooting StepMania

StepMania can be tricky to install and the process has different stumbling points unique to each OS.

If you're having trouble installing StepMania, refer to the [Troubleshooting StepMania README](./other/TroubleshootingStepMania-README.md) included with Simply Love.

### Other Setup/Troubleshooting Resources

The StepMania project has wiki pages for configuring USB profiles for [Windows](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/wiki/Static-Mount-Points-for-USB-Profiles-(Windows)) and [Linux](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/wiki/Creating-Static-Mount-Points-For-USB-Profiles-%28Linux%29).  USB profiles are handy for public arcade machines so that players can enjoy their own custom content from USB drives.

GitHub user geefr has a [wiki page](https://github.com/geefr/stepmania-linux-goodies/wiki/So-You-Think-You-Have-Polling-Issues) on identifying and troubleshooting USB polling rate issues.

## Features


#### New GameModes

* [Casual](http://imgur.com/zLLhDWQh.png) – Intended for novice players; restricted song list, no failing, no LifeMeter, simplified UI, etc.  You can read more about customizing what content appears in Casual Mode [here](./Other/CasualMode-README.md).
* [ITG](http://imgur.com/HS03hhJh.png) – Play using the *In the Groove* standards established over a decade ago
* [FA+](http://imgur.com/teZtlbih.png) – Similar to ITG, but features tighter TimingWindows; can be used to qualify for ECFA events
* [StomperZ](http://imgur.com/dOKTpVbh.png) – Emulates a very small set of features from Rhythm Horizon gameplay

#### New Auxiliary Features

  * [Live Step Statistics](https://imgur.com/w4ddgSK.png) – This optional gameplay overlay tracks how many of each judgment have been earned in real time and features a notes-per-second density histogram.  This can make livestreaming more interesting for viewers.
  * [Judgment Scatter Plot](https://imgur.com/JK5Li2w.png) – ScreenEvaluation now features a judgment scatterplot where notes hit early are rendered "below the middle" and notes hit late are rendered "above the middle." This can offer insight into how a player performed over time. Did the player gradually hit notes earlier and earlier as the song wore on? This feature can help players answer such questions.
  * [Judgment Density Histogram](https://imgur.com/FAuieAf.png) – The evaluation screen also now features a histogram that will help players assess whether they are more often hitting notes early or late.
  * [Per-Column Judgment Breakdown](https://imgur.com/ErcvncM.png)
  * [IIDX-inspired Pacemaker](http://imgur.com/NwN8Fnbh.png)
  * [QR Code Integration with GrooveStats](https://imgur.com/olgg4hS.png) – Evaluation now displays a QR code that will upload the score you just earned to your [GrooveStats](http://groovestats.com/) account.
